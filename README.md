# AutoPenTest

AutoPenTest is a Python script that performs automated penetration testing on web applications and APIs. It uses tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite to simulate attacks and identify potential vulnerabilities in the application, allowing the security team to fix them before they are exploited by real attackers.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    OWASP ZAP
    Burp Suite

Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoPenTest.git

    Install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download and install OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.

Usage

To run the script, open a terminal window and navigate to the AutoPenTest directory. Then run the following command:

php

python autopentest.py <target_url>

Replace <target_url> with the URL of the web application or API you want to test.
Output

The script will output the results of the penetration testing in a report file, which will be saved in the reports directory. The report will include information about any vulnerabilities that were found, along with recommendations for how to fix them.
